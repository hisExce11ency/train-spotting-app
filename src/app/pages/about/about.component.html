        <h1>About TrainSpotter</h1>
        <p>TrainSpotter is a community-powered platform where train enthusiasts and spotters from around the world can
            share their passion for railways. Whether you’re capturing the iconic silhouettes of vintage steam trains or
            the sleek lines of modern high-speed locomotives, TrainSpotter gives you the tools to track, log, and share
            every unique sighting.</p>

        <h2>Capture. Connect. Contribute.</h2>
        <p>TrainSpotter relies on the contributions of passionate spotters. As a member, you can log every train
            sighting with just a few taps: pin its location, upload a photo, describe its composition, and note its
            direction of movement. Each sighting builds your unique MySpots page, a personal collection where you can
            track all your adventures along the rails.</p>

        <h2>Support the Spotters You Love</h2>
        <p>Our platform also offers a unique way for spotters to monetise their photography. Visitors can support their
            favourite spotters by purchasing custom products featuring these one-of-a-kind train images. With just a
            click, images can be printed on T-shirts, mugs, or framed wall art, letting fans bring these beautiful
            trains into their own lives. Every purchase supports the original spotter, helping them continue their
            craft, with a portion of each sale reinvested into growing and improving TrainSpotter.</p>

        <h2>Join the Movement</h2>
        <p>TrainSpotter is more than an app – it’s a movement for those who feel the thrill of a train rumbling past and
            see the beauty in each carriage, line, and landscape. Join us, log your spots, explore the growing community
            map, and find the railways from a new perspective.</p>
